Peanuts and kiddie molotov cocktails on a starved stomach on sunday afternoons. i've got tobacco allergies, and a bloody tongued cat lick tickling the li'l piggy peeping out of a size and a half ago shoe. i watch myself in the fishtank mirror in the corner. all the fish died for friday's fish fry. i'm watching a sunken ship. one sunday, like a likeable bully, he pulls to a picnic and builds a fire. december embers trickle up, set roots in soil sky as january's stars.
